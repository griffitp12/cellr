# cellr 0.0.1

A project to help keep track of what Wines my wife and I like.

NOTE: The frontend of this app is just a placeholder for now.

## Project Status

The Frontend is currently just a placeholder. At the moment I'm focusing on code architecture and developing the api.

## Instillation and setup instructions
Fork, clone, and then

- To install dependancies:

    `npm install`

- To compile and set up the Vue SPA for hot-reloading:

    `npm run serve`


- To compile and run the Node server:

    `npm run back`

- To set tsc to watch mode if you'd like to make changes to the back end in realtime:

    `tsc -w`

## Reflection

SSo far, this has been an excellent exercise in re-familiarizing myself with working with REST API design. There's still a long way to go, and I'm particularly looking forward to designing a many to many database schema that works :laughing:
